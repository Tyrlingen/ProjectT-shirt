# Project Description

Welcome to Project T-shirt! This is a project made by Group 25 (2020) for the course Multi-platform programming at Malmö University, with the goal to become better at programming dynamic webpages. The application lets you generate a T-shirt by getting a user-decided amount of random words from https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home, and then deciding the style of the T-shirt (Shirt color, text color, text align). The T-shirt can then be saved to a library via the localstorage, so that you can view your glorious creations!

## Why React?

We chose to use React to build this application since it is one of the biggest frameworks for making a webpage dynamic with JavaScript. Competitors included Angular.js and Vue.js, two pretty similar frameworks. Angular.js is pretty tightly knit together with TypeScript, which nobody in the group felt comfortable with, since it would mean having to both learn the framework and TypeScript. No-one in the group had previous experience using Vue.js, either, and we felt that having at least one person who is comfortable with the subject would be more fruitful since it opens up the possibility for pair programming, which in turn makes it less time-consuming to find errors and fix bugs.
